## Applies Bad Egg Branding to the Wordpress login page.
We wrote this plugin for our client websites and made it available to everyone so that it can be used as a reference for writig your own Wordpress login page customisations without needing to rely on bloated plugins.

### Plugin Features

- Bundled with [Athlon's Frontend Webpack Boilerplate](https://weareathlon.github.io/frontend-webpack-boilerplate/) to build the styles and scripts
- Includes a nifty javascript function to serve different video formats that support the alpha channel in the browser
- Relies solely on core wordpress hooks that are specific to the login page.
